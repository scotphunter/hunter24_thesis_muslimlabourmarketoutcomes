Muslim Labour Market Outcomes in the Context of New Migrations from Eastern Europe to the UK 


Abstract: 

This thesis investigates the impact of contemporary migration patterns on Muslim communities in the UK. Post-war immigration has significantly changed Britain’s ethnic composition, with Muslim communities facing inequalities such as lower economic activity, higher unemployment, lower wages, and limited access to advantaged occupations. The 2004 EU accession brought many Eastern Europeans to the UK. These contemporary migration trends sparked public fears about impacts on education, housing, wages, and job competition. Despite research debunking these fears, the effects on earlier established ethnic minorities, particularly Muslims, remain underexplored.
 This study encompasses three interrelated empirical analyses to examine the socio-economic inequalities experienced by Muslims and how these might be impacted by contemporary migrations. These analyses entail theoretically informed advanced statistical modelling of data from Understanding Society –– The UK Household Longitudinal Survey (UKHLS). The UKHLS is an ongoing, large scale, nationally representative survey with measures on ethnicity, religion, work and employment which are essential for exploring Muslim circumstances. In addition, macro-level migration data from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) is used to explore the potential impacts of new migrations on Muslim communities. 
Informed by intersectionality (the theory that social inequalities have combined effects), the analysis highlights the multidimensional Muslim experience (for example ethnic, gender, religious and generational effects). Contrary to orientalist narratives that suggest Muslims self-exclude due to cultural or religious reasons, this study reveals that even when Muslims are well integrated into British society, they continue to face disadvantages. This ongoing disparity suggests that it is challenging to attribute their poorer outcomes to anything other than discrimination. Furthermore, this research challenges the notion that new migrations disrupt local labour market opportunities for Muslims, demonstrating that disadvantages persist regardless of these demographic changes.
